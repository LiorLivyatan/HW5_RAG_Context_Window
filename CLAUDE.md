# CLAUDE.md - AI Development Log

## Project Overview
This document tracks all AI-assisted development for Homework 5 - MSc Computer Science LLM Course.
The entire project is built using AI tools (Claude Code) following academic excellence standards.

## Development Session Log

### Session 1: Project Initialization - 2025-12-09

#### Documents Reviewed
1. **self-assessment-guide.pdf** (Version 2.0, 22-11-2025)
   - Comprehensive grading rubric (0-100 points)
   - 7 major categories with specific criteria
   - Technical inspection checklists for package organization, multiprocessing, and building blocks

2. **software_submission_guidelines.pdf** (Version 2.0)
   - Guidelines for excellent software submission
   - Requirements for PRD, architecture documentation, code quality
   - ISO/IEC 25010 quality standards compliance

#### AI Tools Used
- **Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)** - Primary development assistant
- Model ID: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

#### Initial Files Created
- `CLAUDE.md` - This development log
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Overall project structure and implementation plan
- `GRADING_CHECKLIST.md` - Self-assessment tracking against grading criteria
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

#### Key Insights from Document Review

**Grading Breakdown (100 points total):**
- Project Documentation (PRD, Architecture): 20%
- README & Code Documentation: 15%
- Project Structure & Code Quality: 15%
- Configuration & Security: 10%
- Testing & QA: 15%
- Research & Analysis: 15%
- UI/UX & Extensibility: 10%

**Critical Technical Requirements:**
1. Package organization as a proper Python package (pyproject.toml/setup.py)
2. Multiprocessing for CPU-bound operations
3. Multithreading for I/O-bound operations
4. Building blocks-based modular design
5. Comprehensive testing (70%+ coverage for new code)
6. Proper configuration management (.env files, no hardcoded secrets)
7. Full documentation including architecture diagrams (C4 Model, UML)

**Academic Requirements:**
- Self-assessment justification (200-500 words)
- Academic integrity declaration
- Detailed prompt engineering log
- Cost analysis (token usage)

#### Next Steps
1. Define the project concept and requirements (PRD)
2. Design system architecture
3. Set up project structure following best practices
4. Implement core functionality with AI assistance
5. Document all AI prompts used
6. Create comprehensive tests
7. Generate analysis and visualizations
8. Complete self-assessment

## Prompt Engineering Log

### Prompt 1 - Initial Setup
**Objective:** Review assignment documents and initialize project structure

**Prompt to Claude:**
```
In this repo we will create together Homework 5 for a course that I am taking.
This assignment should be fully built with AI tools, like Claude Code (you!).
Before we begin, and before I give you the assignment, attached to the repo are two super-important files:
1. '/Users/liorlivyatan/Desktop/Livyatan/MSc CS/LLM Course/HW5/self-assessment-guide.pdf' - we should give ourselves the grade for the assignment (from 0 to 100). This file contains all details needed to get a grade of 100. We must follow this (and even beyond to make sure we get a 100).
2. '/Users/liorlivyatan/Desktop/Livyatan/MSc CS/LLM Course/HW5/software_submission_guidelines.pdf' - this files contains the general rules of the assignment that must be followed in order to get 100.
Let's start by you reviewing both files, and initiate the CLAUDE.md file and any other .md file you think that is important in order for you to develop this assignment. Ultrathink!
```

**AI Response:**
- Successfully read and analyzed both PDF documents
- Identified key grading criteria and technical requirements
- Created structured markdown files for project organization

**Outcome:** ✅ Successfully initialized project documentation structure

## AI Contribution Tracking

### Code Generated
- [ ] No code generated yet

### Documentation Generated
- [x] CLAUDE.md - AI development log (this file)
- [x] PROJECT_PLAN.md - Project planning and structure
- [x] GRADING_CHECKLIST.md - Self-assessment tracking
- [x] REQUIREMENTS.md - Product Requirements Document

### Decisions Made with AI
1. **File Structure:** Created comprehensive markdown documentation before coding
2. **Documentation First:** Following academic best practices by planning before implementation
3. **Tracking System:** Established systematic logging of all AI interactions

## Technical Decisions Log

### Architecture Decisions
- TBD - Awaiting project concept definition

### Technology Stack
- TBD - Will be determined based on project requirements

### Design Patterns
- Building blocks pattern (required by guidelines)
- Modular package organization (required)
- Multiprocessing/multithreading for parallel operations (required)

---

## Cost Tracking

### Token Usage
- Session 1 Initial Setup: ~20,000 tokens (reading PDFs + file creation)

### Total Project Cost
- Running total: TBD
- Will track all API calls and token usage throughout development

---

## Quality Assurance Notes

### Standards Compliance
- [ ] ISO/IEC 25010 quality model adherence
- [ ] Academic integrity maintained
- [ ] All AI assistance documented transparently

### Best Practices Applied
- Comprehensive documentation before coding
- Systematic tracking of AI contributions
- Clear separation of concerns in file organization

---

## Next Session Planning

### Immediate Tasks
1. Get user input on project concept/domain
2. Define specific problem to solve
3. Create detailed PRD
4. Design system architecture
5. Set up Python package structure

### Questions for User
- What domain/problem should this project address?
- Any specific technologies or libraries preferred?
- Time constraints or milestones?
